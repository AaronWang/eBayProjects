<h2 align="center"><b>consoleAddItemDirect</b></h2>
This is a sample console application that shows how to create a new item and list it to eBay (using
AddItemCall) without using the AddItemCall wrapper class. It
prompts user to enter account and the new item information then uses AddItemCall to list
the new item to eBay. Please refer to the <a href="../readme.htm">README</a>
of samples for build instructions.
